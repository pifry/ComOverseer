## ComOverseer (Serial ports monitor)

# Brief
Shows available serial ports every time something is connected or disconnected from the system.

# Detailed Description
This little application is particularly useful when you work with many Serial-to-USB converrters. You connecting 
converter to the system and you have no idea what serial port number it gets (e.g. COM21). Normaly you have to do 
several additional things to discover this (such as going through the device manager). When you run this 
application, every time, when you connect Serial-to-USB converter, small baloon tip shows in the corner of your 
pulpit, showing the list of actually installed serial ports with the newly connected marked as "NEW!".

# Installation
The binary works as stanalone application and do not need any installation process. To have it working all the 
time just drop it into the autostart folder. To disable it, just click it with a right mouse button and choose 
"Close".
